Developer Implementation-Only License (DIO) — Version 1.0
Copyright (c) [year] [copyright owner]

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person or organization ("Licensee") obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Original Work"), to use, copy, reproduce,
modify, and prepare derivative works of the Original Work, subject to the following conditions:

1. Definitions
   - "Own Project" means a software project that is created, maintained, and controlled by the Licensee
     (or by an entity that employs or otherwise controls the Licensee), and that functions as a distinct,
     larger work or product (for example, an application, service, or combined software package)
     in which the Original Work is incorporated or embedded.
   - "Standalone Distribution" means distributing the Original Work by itself (as an independent file,
     single-purpose package, library, plugin, module, or component) in a manner intended for reuse,
     redistribution, or integration by third parties independent of the Licensee's Own Project.

2. Grant of Rights (Implementation-Only)
   - Subject to the terms below, the Copyright Holder grants the Licensee a worldwide, non-exclusive,
     non-transferable, royalty-free license to:
     a) copy, reproduce, modify, and create derivative works of the Original Work; and
     b) distribute the Original Work and any modifications or derivatives,
     provided that such distribution is only as part of an Own Project (i.e., the Original Work is
     embedded in, compiled into, or distributed together with a larger software product under the
     Licensee's control).
   - The rights granted in this section expressly exclude any right to distribute the Original Work
     or any derivative as a Standalone Distribution.

3. Distribution Conditions
   - When the Original Work (or a derivative that contains or is based on the Original Work) is distributed
     as part of an Own Project, the Licensee must:
     a) include a copy of this license text with the Own Project's distribution that contains the Original Work;
     b) retain and reproduce all existing copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices that
        appear in the Original Work; and
     c) clearly identify which files or components in the Own Project are covered by this license.
   - The Licensee may license the remainder of their Own Project under terms of their choosing, provided
     the portions derived from or including the Original Work remain subject to this Developer
     Implementation-Only License and are identified as such.

4. Prohibited Uses
   - Except as expressly permitted above, the Licensee may not:
     a) distribute the Original Work (or any portion of it) as a standalone library, package, module,
        plugin, or other component intended for reuse by third parties outside the context of the Own Project;
     b) sublicense the Original Work as a separate, independent module; or
     c) remove, obscure, or alter the attribution and license notices required by Section 3.
   - Any attempt to exercise rights not granted by this license terminates the license granted to the
     Licensee as of the date of that breach.

5. Contribution Handling
   - If the Licensee contributes modifications back to the Original Work's upstream project (if any),
     such contributions are governed by the contributor agreement or license asked for by the upstream
     project. The Licensee's grant to distribute as part of their Own Project does not impose any obligation
     on the original copyright holder to accept contributions or change the Original Work's licensing.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty
   - THE ORIGINAL WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
     INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
     OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE ORIGINAL WORK REMAINS WITH THE LICENSEE.

7. Limitation of Liability
   - IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
     PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION)
     HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT
     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE ORIGINAL WORK,
     EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

8. Termination
   - This license and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if the Licensee fails to comply
     with any of its terms. Termination does not limit any liability that accrued prior to termination. On termination,
     the Licensee must cease distributing the Original Work except as permitted under Section 2 for previously distributed copies.

9. Miscellaneous
   - This license does not grant any patent rights beyond those expressly stated. Nothing in this license
     limits a party's rights under applicable law or does anything to affect other agreements (for example,
     employment agreements) that might govern ownership of code or contributions.
   - If any provision of this license is found to be unenforceable, the remainder of the license remains in full force and effect.

10. Interpretation and Legal Advice
   - This is a template license provided for convenience. It is not legal advice. If you need a license tailored
     to a specific situation, including commercial uses, contributions, or compatibility with other licenses,
     consult a qualified attorney.
